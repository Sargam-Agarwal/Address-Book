# 🏘 Address Book App

A simple Flutter App that let's the user add and save all the important and frequently needed addresses at one place in their mobile device. 

My motivation behind working on this app !? In simple words, I didn't want my friends (or anyone for that matter) to give me spoilers when sending me gifts just because they dont have my address saved anywhere, which happened around the same time when I was looking to work on some Flutter project using a state management technique. So, both these situations combined gave way to the development of this app (which btw, I "return gifted" my friends on my birthday 😎).
